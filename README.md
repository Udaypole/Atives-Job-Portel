What is Atives?
Atives is a platform built for creatives‚Äîdesigners, developers, photographers, and artists‚Äîto showcase their portfolios, discover jobs, and connect with like-minded professionals. I created this to solve three pain points:

Fragmented portfolios (No central place for multi-disciplinary work)

Boring job boards (Most lack creative-friendly filtering)

Isolated communities (Hard to find collaborators)

Key Features
